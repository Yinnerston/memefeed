# Memefeed

Meme image and caption database store and viewer.

Why make a CRUD app? I have much more to learn in terms of system architecture, performance monitoring, and optimization.
I've also never implemented a caching server nor have I delved deeply into postgres optimization, so I want to gain some experience with these things whilst picking up Django.

Server is run on localhost port 8000.
